### Brick Breaker with Typescript

It's a simple brick breaker built with javascript.

## Getting started
Make sure typescript is installed. You can install it by running
```
  npm install -g typescript
```

If installed, you can run 
```
tsc --watch
```
And make whatever changes you want to the Point.ts file
